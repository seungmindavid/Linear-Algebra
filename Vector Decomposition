Vector deomposition rules

1. Vector u is orthogonal to vector v (meaning u·v = 0)
2. Vector v is aligned with b (they have a zero angle)

Then, let's say a, b ∈ R^d two d-dimensional vectors. Let's decompose a into u and v s.t,
1) a = u + v
2) u is orthogonal to v
3) v is aligned with b

Let's first get v. Since v is aligned with b, we need projection of a onto b.
Projection of a onto b = v = ((a·b)/||b||^2) · b

And u is orthogonal to v. Hence, u = a-v
